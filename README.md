# React & Node Calculator

## Description

This is a basic calculator built using React and a node.js server. It was completed in a few hours for a code challenge.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- React
- Material-UI

### Install & Run

1. Download and clone the project files: ```https://github.com/jjschubert/szl_calc_challenge```
2. Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
3. Run npm run server in your terminal
4. Run npm run client in your terminal
5. The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!

	
## Known Limitations & Next Steps

- Currently, the app accepts basic operators (+, -, *, /), as well as decimals. Ideally a future version would also handle negative numbers, percentages, and parentheses. 
- The code uses eval to calculate inputs which has risks, but it is kept on the client side for this reason (rather than in the server).
